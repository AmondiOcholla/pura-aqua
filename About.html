            <h1>Forests</h1>
            <p> African rainforests are unique. For example, they store more carbon than those in the Amazon. On average, a hectare of African rainforest stores 183 tonnes of carbon. The extra carbon in African forests comes from trees being larger; the average
                diameter of a tree in an African rainforest is 1.5 times larger than that of a tree in the Amazon. Trees in African rainforests are also tall. African forests also have fewer tree species than tropical forests in other continents. If you
                were to identify 300 trees in an African forest you would find, on average, 65 species, compared to 109 species in the Amazon and 120 species in South East Asia. This low diversity may partly be a legacy of past climate, with dry periods
                in the past wiping out species that require wet conditions all year round. African rainforests are still important centres of biodiversity despite having fewer tree species than other rainforests. Forests need to be protected to safeguard
                both the huge number of species that live in them and the vast amounts of carbon they store.

            <h1>Animals</h1>
            <P>Africa is best known for the enormous diversity and richness of its wildlife. It has a greater variety of large ungulates, or hoofed mammals (some 90 species), and freshwater fish (2,000 species) than any other continent. The main group of
                herbivores are the African antelope, which belong to four subfamilies of the ox family (Bovidae). The first subfamily is the oxlike Bovinae, which is further subdivided into the African buffalo and the twist-horned antelope, including
                the eland (the largest of all antelope), kudu, nyala, and bushbuck. The second subfamily is the duiker, a small primitive bovid that lives in the thickets, bush, and forests. Third is the “horse antelope,” further divided into sabre-horned
                sable, roan, and oryx antelope; the “deer antelope,” kongonis, hartebeest, topi, gnu (wildebeest), and blesbok, all mostly inhabitants of the open plains; and the “marsh antelope,” waterbuck, lechwe, kob, puku, and reedbuck. The fourth
                subfamily is the antelope proper, divided into two distinct tribes, the first of which includes royal, dik-dik, klipspringer, oribi, steenbok, and grysbok and the second of which includes gazelle, impala, springbok, and gerenuk. Other
                well-known large African herbivores include the zebra, giraffe, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, and African elephant.</p>
            <p>Marine mammals include one Mediterranean and one South African seal (the Cape fur seal) and two Sirenia (an order of aquatic herbivores)—the dugong and the manatee. In addition, whales, porpoises, and dolphins frequent Africa’s coastal waters.
                Africa’s large number of endemic mammal species is second only to that of South America.

            <h1>Water</h1>
            <p>
                <B>WATER</B> Water is pivotal to our development as a people, and in Africa it will be the defining resource in our shared urban future. How we respond to the multiple water challenges and the way we manage water is what will determine how and where
                we live, our economic successes and failures, and our development paths. Cities worldwide are facing severe physical, social environmental and economic impacts due to climate change. These are anticipated to be felt with greater intensity
                in the developing world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, in the near future. Coupled with this, cities in Africa also need to plan for increasing populations, rapid urbanisation and the rising demand for more infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p> The impact of climate change on water resources and infrastructure is particularly profound. It is well recognised that freshwater is linked to all aspects of human development and wellbeing. Its availability is the single largest major natural
                limit to economic growth, given that all other sectors are dependent on its secure supply. Water resources are globally scarce and cities are having to resort to extreme measures to establish water security. To put this in context, sub-Saharan
                Africa has the largest number of water stressed countries of any region, with only 9% of global freshwater resources being located in Africa. In addition, a report from the World Bank shows that in Africa, water demand is increasing at
                a higher rate than population growth.

                    Africa could be spared a host of respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, through cleaner air, but air pollution data across the continent that could influence policy is of poor quality or inaccessible, making efforts to track air quality difficult.
                    Now, satellite data can predict air quality in cities and towns and can plug the gap in African cities without ground-based sensors. Strong community activism often succeeds in holding governments accountable for ensuring they reduce
                    air pollution; environmental groups have taken the South African Government to court over violations of the constitutional right to clean air. Research shows that 14 facilities (12 coal-powered plants and two fuel refineries) had caused
                    between 305 and 650 early deaths in 2016. Mpumalanga province accounts for about 83% of South Africa's coal production. There is lack of substantive capacity for air quality measurement. Only seven of 54 African countries have reliable,
                    real-time air pollution monitors, says a 2019 UNICEF report. Ground-based, real-time data helps to capture fluctuations in air quality, which is important to improve public awareness, and to help people to alter their behaviours to
                    reduce air pollution and exposure to it. </p>

            <h1>SOIL</h1>
            <p>To yield abundant crops, an agrarian has to seed the right plant, at the right time, and in the right place. The right place is determined not only by the geographic location and climate peculiarities but types of soil as well. Each of them
                has their advantages and disadvantages, and different types of soils are suitable for growing different crops in regard to: Nutrient content: is it sufficient for plants or do you have to provide additional fertilizing?
                <ol>
                    <li>Tilling: how easily is the land cultivated? Thus, you can plant crops that either need frequent cultivation or do not.</li>
                    <li>Watering/irrigation: how quickly does water seek and drain? Correspondingly, will additional water supply be required or just on the contrary, irrigation to take extra moisture away? Managing these key agricultural activities you can
                        make the best of the situation</li>
